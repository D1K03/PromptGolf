# PromptGolf — 24hr Implementation Plan

Team of 3 (A backend, B UI, C content). Demo-first. Project context lives in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Stage 0 — Foundations (Hr 0–2) — A + B + C parallel

**Person A — backend setup**
- Strip `DATABASE_URL` from env, add Upstash + Pusher + fal vars
- `npm install @upstash/redis @fal-ai/client pusher pusher-js nanoid zod framer-motion howler @vercel/og`
- `npm install -D @types/howler`
- `/lib/redis.ts`, `/lib/pusher.ts`, `/lib/fal.ts` skeletons
- Smoke-test all three credentials with throwaway endpoints

**Person B — theme + primitives**
- Replace lyra preset → custom jklm tokens in `globals.css`
- Fredoka + Inter via `next/font`
- `npx shadcn@latest add button input textarea card dialog sonner badge skeleton avatar`
- Override shadcn to chunky borders + drop shadow + active translate-y
- Build `<JklmButton>`, `<JklmCard>`, `<RoomCodeDisplay>` primitives

**Person C — category curation (Hr 0–4)**
- Targets are generated **on-demand per round** from a host-picked category. Person C's job: write one good FLUX prompt per category and verify it produces solid images across seeds.
- ~8–12 categories: e.g. `object`, `scene`, `character`, `abstract`, `food`, `animal`, `style-pastiche`, `unhinged`. Each evocative, demo-friendly.
- `/data/categories.json` shape: `{id, label, emoji, prompt: string, seedRange: [min, max], demoSafe: boolean}`. **One fixed prompt per category.** Round variety comes from sampling a fresh seed from `seedRange` each round.
- Prompt design tips: short enough that golfing it is plausible (~10–25 words), specific enough that CLIP scores correlate with player skill, but not so locked-down that every seed produces an identical image.
- Test gen quality: run each category's prompt across 5 seeds, confirm outputs are recognizable and varied (not identical, not mush). If a prompt produces same image regardless of seed, widen the prompt; if it produces unrecognizable variety, tighten it.
- Demo-first: at least 3 categories must be **bulletproof** (every seed yields a clear, prompt-able image). Mark these `demoSafe: true` so the lobby UI can default to them.

**Domain decision (Hr 0, 5min timebox):** try `prompt.golf → promptgolf.fun → pgolf.fun → playpromptgolf.com`. First available wins. Move on.

## Stage 1 — Threshold + bot (Hr 2–3) — ⚠️ SUPERSEDED 2026-05-09

**CLIP scoring was dropped on 2026-05-09 in favour of pure player voting.** This stage's threshold-calibration work is preserved below for historical context, but none of it is in the live game anymore. `lib/replicate.ts` was deleted; `lib/scoring.ts` no longer exports `cosine`/`qualifies`/`clipPoints`. See CLAUDE.md → Locked Decisions for the new scoring rule.

### Historical: scoring path was validated via `src/app/api/smoke/replicate-clip/route.ts`. fal CLIP path was investigated and rejected (only fal endpoint exposing image embeddings is SAM-3, which is a 1.3M-dim segmentation feature map — doesn't discriminate semantic similarity). Pivoted to **Replicate `andreasjansson/clip-features`** (version-pinned), which returns the standard openai/clip-vit-large-patch14 768-dim embedding. Calibration result on 4-image test (red apple target, identical regen, fuzzy "red apple on table", wrong "yellow banana on grass"):

| Pair | Cosine | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| target ↔ identical regen | **1.000** | confirms FLUX is deterministic with fixed seed |
| target ↔ fuzzy (golfer-style short prompt) | **0.978** | qualifying ceiling |
| target ↔ wrong (different concept) | **0.849** | unrelated baseline |

**Important:** image-image CLIP cosine has a high floor (~0.85 even for unrelated natural photos — the embedding space isn't packed in [0, 1]). Separation is what matters, not absolute. We have ≈+0.13 separation between fuzzy and wrong.

- **Threshold default: 0.88** (between wrong and fuzzy). Recheck per category — different visual styles may shift the band.
- Latency: FLUX gen ~1s, CLIP embed ~0.9s/image. Round-start budget: 1× FLUX (~1s) + 1× CLIP target embed (~0.9s) ≈ 2s, masked by `generating` phase.
- Per-submission budget: 1× FLUX (~1s) + 1× CLIP candidate embed (~0.9s) + cosine in JS (free) ≈ 2s.

**Shipped 2026-05-09:**
- `src/lib/replicate.ts` — `clipEmbed(imageUrl): Promise<number[]>`. Lazy singleton `Replicate` client, version-pinned to `75b33f25...`, throws on missing env or unexpected output shape.
- `src/lib/scoring.ts` — `cosine(a, b)`, `qualifies(sim, threshold)`, `tiebreak<T extends Rankable>(attempts)` implementing `chars → tokens → similarity → submittedAt`.
- `src/lib/fal.ts` — `falGenerate(prompt, seed): Promise<{imageUrl, seed}>`. FLUX schnell @ 4 steps, square_hd, throws on missing env or empty image array.
- `src/lib/__tests__/scoring.test.ts` — 13 vitest cases covering identical/parallel/orthogonal/anti-parallel cosine, length-mismatch throw, qualifies edges, all four tiebreak rungs, immutability.
- `src/app/api/smoke/whoami/` and `src/app/api/smoke/fal/` (SAM-3 path) deleted. `src/app/api/smoke/replicate-clip/` kept until Stage 4 lands.

**Still to do:**
- `/lib/devBot.ts` — fake player, joins room via API, submits random short prompts. Toggle via `?bot=3`.

**Originally-planned escalation gate:** if fal CLIP latency >1s or threshold uncalibratable → escalate. Triggered. Resolved by pivoting to Replicate.

---

## Stage 2 — Rooms core (Hr 2–6) — A

- `/lib/types.ts` — `Room`, `Player`, `RoundState`, `Attempt`, `Scores` (mirror CLAUDE.md → Data Model)
- `/lib/session.ts` — `getOrMintPlayerId()` reads/writes httpOnly cookie; called by every API route + landing page
- `/lib/rooms.ts` — Redis CRUD: `createRoom`, `joinRoom`, `leaveRoom`, `getState`, `setState`. Every write increments `Room.version`.
- 4-letter code via nanoid custom alphabet, no profanity, no `0/O 1/I`
- `/api/rooms` POST create — body: `{ maxPlayers: 1–8, categories, totalRounds: 1–5, timer: 30–120, promptMaxLength: 50–200 }`. Returns `{ code }`.
- `/api/rooms/[code]` GET state, POST join/leave. Every body carries `roomCode` (per convention) — but the path param `[code]` is the source of truth; body `roomCode` must match or 400.
- `/api/pusher/auth` presence + private auth, validates cookie playerId is in the room
- zod schemas on every input
- TTL 1h on every key

---

## Stage 3 — Landing + lobby (Hr 2–6) — B

- `/` landing:
  - On first visit, server mints `playerId` cookie + default name (`Guest-XXXX`) + random `avatarSeed`
  - Editable name input + DiceBear avatar preview (re-rolls seed on click)
  - `[CREATE LOBBY]` opens dialog: max-players slider (1–8), category multi-select from `data/categories.json`, total rounds 1/2/3/4/5, timer 30–120s, prompt max length 50–200
  - `[JOIN: ____]` 4-char input → `/room/[code]`
- `/room/[code]` lobby:
  - DiceBear avatars (URL with `seed = avatarSeed`, not `playerId`, so re-rolls work)
  - Name input, ready toggle, host-only Start button
  - Display chosen categories as badges so players know what kind of target to expect
  - Pusher presence channel auto-syncs roster + populates `connected` / `lastSeenAt`
  - Sounds on join/leave/ready
- Pre-warm fal: dummy generation request fires when lobby mounts (mask cold start) — doubly important now that round target gen is live per round

---

## Stage 4 — Showdown loop (Hr 6–14) — A + B

### ✅ Backend shipped 2026-05-09 (vote-only scoring)

The full server-side round arc is in. State machine: `lobby → generating → playing → voting → reveal → (next round | ended)`. Phase advances are client-driven via `POST { action: "advance" }` against a server-stamped `phaseEndsAt`.

- **`POST /api/v1/rooms/[code] { action: "start" }`** — host-only. Validations + delegates to `generateRoundTarget` helper (FLUX target gen → cache on RoomState → flip to playing with `phaseEndsAt = now + settings.timer * 1000`). On FLUX failure, reverts to lobby and broadcasts `round-failed`.
- **`POST /api/v1/rooms/[code] { action: "advance" }`** — anyone in room. Server validates `Date.now() >= phaseEndsAt` (rejects 409 with the real deadline if early). State machine: `playing → voting (20s)`, `voting → reveal (15s)` (runs `selectFinalAttempts(attempts, picks)` → `awardRoundScores(scores, finals, votes)` → broadcasts `targetPrompt` + `scores`), `reveal → next round | ended` (next round re-runs `generateRoundTarget`).
- **`POST /api/v1/rooms/[code] { action: "pick", attemptId }`** — locks player's "final" attempt for the round. Verifies attempt belongs to caller. Changeable any time during playing. Broadcast `pick-changed { userId }` (value private).
- **`POST /api/v1/generate { roomCode, prompt }`** — player submission. Per-round attempts cap (`settings.attemptsPerRound`) + per-player 3s debounce (atomic Redis NX-EX). Calls `falGenerate(prompt, room.seed)` only — no CLIP. Persists `Attempt` (with placeholder `similarity: 0, qualified: false`) to `room:{CODE}:attempts:{round}`. Broadcast `attempt-submitted`. Returns `{ attempt, attemptsRemaining }`.
- **`POST /api/v1/vote { roomCode, targetUserId }`** — anti-self-vote. Each voter has exactly one vote per round (upserted: re-voting drops the old entry). Persists `Vote` to `room:{CODE}:votes:{round}`. Broadcast `vote-submitted { voterId, round }` (target private until reveal).
- **`GET /api/v1/rooms/[code]/round/[n]`** — for voting carousel + reveal screen. Returns `{ finalAttempts, votes, targetImageUrl, targetPrompt? }`. `targetPrompt` only when status ∈ {reveal, ended}.

**Scoring formula (in `lib/scoring.ts`):** single-vote tally. Each player has one vote per round; each vote = 1 point to that target. `awardRoundScores(scores, _finals, votes)` counts votes by `targetId` and accumulates onto `room.scores`. `selectFinalAttempts(attempts, picks)` resolves picks → fallback to last-submitted attempt.

**CLIP scoring was investigated, validated, and dropped** in favour of pure social voting (team call). `lib/replicate.ts` deleted; `Attempt.similarity`/`qualified` and `RoomSettings.difficulty` are vestigial fields. The Replicate calibration data and SAM-3 dead-end are documented in Stage 1 (above) for historical context.

**Tests:** 59 vitest cases in `src/lib/__tests__/scoring.test.ts` covering tiebreak (4), selectFinalAttempts (5), awardRoundScores (6) — including the "4 excellents = 40" spec example.

### Still to do for Stage 4

**A — server, ~30 min each:**
- Disconnect grace: Pusher `member_removed` webhook → flip `connected: false` + `lastSeenAt = now()`. At round-end, DNF anyone with `!connected && now - lastSeenAt > disconnectGraceMs` (30s).
- Host succession: when host leaves, promote next player by `joinedAt`.
- Pre-warm fal: dummy gen request when lobby mounts (mask cold start).

**B — UI (this is where the rest lives):**
- Client-side countdown to `room.phaseEndsAt`. Auto-fire `POST { action: "advance" }` when it hits 0.
- Playing-phase UI: target image, prompt input (live char counter), submit, attempt cards with "pick this one" button, "X attempts left" badge.
- Voting-phase UI: target image displayed alongside each player's final attempt (fetched via `GET .../round/[n]`); voter clicks ONE non-self image to vote for it; voting again replaces the previous vote.
- Reveal-phase UI: secret target prompt revealed, per-player finals + who-voted-for-whom (or just vote counts), running cumulative leaderboard.
- Game-end UI: final scores, share card link.

---

## Stage 5 — Spectator view (Hr 12–14) — B

- `/room/[code]/spectate` — projector layout
- Read-only Pusher subscriber, no controls
- Big target image left, live leaderboard right
- Current attempts stream in with thumbnails
- QR code top-right linking to `/room/[code]` for crowd to join
- This is the big-screen demo upgrade

---

## Stage 6 — Polish (Hr 14–18) — A + B

- Framer Motion: button presses, card flips, score count-up, stagger reveals
- Mobile: sticky prompt input, keyboard handling, test iOS Safari + Android Chrome
- Loading skeletons, error toasts (sonner)
- Edge cases: 1 player, host disconnect → promote next, fal failure (retry once → DNF)
- Sound layer: submit ding, qualified chime, DNF buzz, round-end fanfare

---

## Stage 7 — Share card (Hr 18–20) — C

- `/api/og/[attemptId]` via `@vercel/og`
- Layout: target image + winner's generated image + prompt + char count + "PromptGolf"
- "Share" button on reveal screen → copy link + auto-tweet w/ prefilled text
- OG meta tags on `/room/[code]` for social previews
- Twitter post-hackathon = free reach

---

## Stage 8 — Deploy + domain (Hr 20–22) — A

- Custom domain → Vercel
- Production env vars
- Final deploy, smoke test prod end-to-end on real phones
- Cache headers on `/public/targets/`
- Verify Pusher prod cluster, Upstash prod region

---

## Stage 9 — Demo prep (Hr 22–24) — All

- Decide pitcher (calmest under pressure)
- Rehearse 30s pitch 5×
- 3× full demo run-through on real phones
- Pre-create demo room w/ memorable code
- Pre-warm fal w/ scheduled background ping
- Backup plan: 90s pre-recorded video if realtime breaks
- Hotspot ready in case venue Wi-Fi flakes

---

## Hour Schedule

| Hr | Person A (backend) | Person B (UI) | Person C (content) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–2 | env, deps, smoke tests, domain, `lib/types.ts` + `lib/session.ts` | jklm theme, shadcn primitives | Category taxonomy + first FLUX gen tests |
| 2–3 | Threshold + round-gen spike + host bot | Landing page (cookie mint, name/avatar editor) | Continue category tuning |
| 2–6 | Rooms API + Redis + `/api/round/start` skeleton | Lobby + category badges + presence | Finalize `categories.json`, mark `demoSafe` |
| 6–14 | Generate API + scoring + state machine + disconnect reaper | Game UI + reveal screen (incl. `generating` phase) | Help test gens, start spectator if A/B blocked |
| 12–14 | — | Spectator view | — |
| 14–18 | Polish, edge cases | Polish, sounds, animations | Share card / OG route |
| 18–20 | Pre-warm + cache + fal optim | Mobile pass | Share card finalize |
| 20–22 | Deploy + domain | Demo run-through | Pitch rehearsal |
| 22–24 | Buffer + smoke test | Buffer | Buffer |

## Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| fal latency >2s breaks per-submission pacing | HIGH | FLUX schnell 4 steps, fixed seed, loading anim masks. Pre-warm on lobby mount. |
| Round-target gen latency stalls round start | MED | Now: 1× FLUX (~1s) only. `generating` phase still masks the wait. Lower than pre-pivot since CLIP step removed. |
| Voting feels random with low player counts | MED | Single-vote scoring caps round points at `playerCount - 1` (everyone except the target votes for them). With 3 players, max round = 2; one vote can flip outcomes. Mitigations: encourage 4+ players in demo; longer game (5 rounds) smooths variance. |
| Category produces unrecognizable images | MED | Person C tests each category 5× during Hr 0–4. Mark `demoSafe: true` only after passing. Demo defaults to safe categories. |
| Demo Wi-Fi flakes | HIGH | Hotspot backup. Pre-recorded video fallback. |
| Pusher free tier cap | MED | Cap rooms to 8 players (`settings.maxPlayers`). One demo room only. |
| Mobile keyboard covers UI | MED | Test Hr 6 not Hr 22. Sticky input bar. |
| Cost runaway from on-demand gen | MED | Was LOW with pre-gen targets — bumped because every round is now a paid call. Per-room rate limit, $20 hard cap, debounce. Cap rooms per session. |
| Host disconnects mid-game | MED | 30s grace via `disconnectGraceMs`. On expiry, promote next player by `joinedAt` order. |
| Player exploits reveal-after-reconnect | LOW | 30s grace doesn't extend past round end — DNF reaper runs at `reveal` transition, no second chance. |

## What's Already Done

- Next.js 15 + TS + Tailwind v4 + shadcn (lyra preset) scaffold
- `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, README, initial commit

---

## First Actions on Go

- **Person A:** drop lyra → install deps → set env → smoke test Pusher/Upstash/fal credentials → buy domain (5min) → scaffold `lib/types.ts` + `lib/session.ts` (cookie playerId)
- **Person B:** write jklm theme tokens in `globals.css` → install fonts → add shadcn primitives → start landing with name editor + avatar re-roll
- **Person C:** draft 8–12 categories with prompt fragments → run each 5× through FLUX schnell → mark winners `demoSafe: true` → land in `data/categories.json` by Hr 4
